## Tech Stack

**Front end:**

[![Front-end](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,tailwind,vue)](https://skillicons.dev)

**Back end:**

[![Back-end](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,mysql,laravel)](https://skillicons.dev)
## Installation

First of all you need to run the database locally using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download/) or any similar program that can run MySQL databases.

To clone this repo use:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThisMSH/ShowTime.git
```

After that follow these steps to install all the necessary dependencies for both front end and back end.

### Front end

Go to the Frontend directory:
```bash
    cd ShowTime/Frontend
```

Now to install the dependencies run the command (Make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed in your machine):
```bash
    npm i
```

The front end should be ready to run now.
If you want to run the front end in development mode just use the command:
```bash
    npm run dev
```
***
And if you want to run the front end in production mode, first use:
```bash
    npm run build
```

Then install `serve` package if you don't have it already:
```bash
    npm install --global serve
```

And finally:
```bash
    serve dist
```

### Back end

Now go to the backend directory:
```bash
    cd ../Backend
```

To install all dependencies run the command (Make sure that you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) installed in your machine):
```bash
    composer install
```

Now run the following commands to make a copy of `.env.example` file and generate `API_KEY`:
```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
```

Now create a new database, and then open `.env` and modify it:
```bash
    ### Modify the port for the back-end (8000 by default)
    APP_URL=http://localhost:xxxx 

    ### Modify the port for the front-end (3000 by default)
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:yyyy 
    SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost:yyyy 
    SESSION_DOMAIN=localhost

    LOG_CHANNEL=stack
    LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL=null
    LOG_LEVEL=debug

    ### Here you can modify value of these variables to match your database
    ### Make sure to change the name of the database, username, and password if you set one  
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=database-name
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
```

To create all the tables run:
```bash
    php artisan migrate
```

Now run the following commands:
```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    php artisan db:seed --class=CategorySeeder
```

These 2 commands will create 4 categories and 3 accounts in the database, each account has a specific role. Here are the emails and passwords to access each one of them from login page:
|                   |        Email        | Password |
|-------------------| ------------------- | -------- |
|**Regular account**| regular@example.com | password |
|**Premium account**| premium@example.com | password |
|**Admin account**  | admin@example.com   | password |

More about these roles later.

Now run this command to make the storage directory publicly accessible:
```bash
    php artisan storage:link
```

And now you should be all set to run the back end, all you need to do is to run this command:
```bash
    php artisan ser
```
After this all you need to do is to visit the link that was generated by VueJS (By default: http://localhost:3000/)

***
#### Additional information
You can generate more random users by using **Laravel Tinker**, here is an example of generating 20 users:
```bash
    php artisan tinker

    User::factory(20)->create();
```
Now you will have an additional 20 users with random information. You can do the same method with **ratings**, but make sure that you already added some shows and users in your database:
```bash
    Rating::factory(250)->create();
```
This will create 250 random ratings `(1 to 10)` that will belong to random shows and users.
## Appendix

### Actors

**ShowTime** has mainly 4 actors:

* **1st - Visitor:** Visitors can basically browse and discover all the shows, watch the trailers and read community's comments on every episode. However, they can't watch any episode, nor they have access to the dashboard.
* **2nd - Regular users:** In addition of what visitors can do, **regular users** can also watch free episodes and they have their own dashboard where they can modify their information, see and manage their lists of favorite shows and rated shows, they can also add comments on the episodes and manage their own comments. However, they can't watch premium episodes.
* **3rd - Premium users:** In addition of what regular users can do, **premium users** can also watch premium episodes.
* **4th - Admin users:** Admin users have full control on the platform. An admin can:
    * Manage the comments of any users (Update or delete them)
    * Manage the users (Update their information or permanently delete a user)
    * Manage the shows (Create, update or delete a show)
    * Manage the episodes (Create, update or delete a episode)
    * Manage the trailers (Create, update or delete a trailer)
    * Manage the subtitles (Create, update or delete a subtitle)
    * Manage the recommandations (Create, update or delete a recommandation)

### Side note
After following the [Installation](#installation) guide and running the project, make sure to add some shows (At least 5 in each category) so you can see the platform alive with bunch of shows.
